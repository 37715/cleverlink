# Email Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automated email functionality for your CleverLink website. When users submit the contact form, they'll receive a confirmation email and you'll receive a notification.

## Overview

The email system consists of:
- **Confirmation emails** sent to users who submit the form
- **Notification emails** sent to `cleverlink.ai@outlook.com` for each form submission
- Beautiful, responsive email templates matching your brand

## Prerequisites

- Supabase project with CLI access
- Domain access (cleverlink.uk)

## Step 1: Set up Resend Account

1. **Sign up for Resend**
   - Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Create a free account (includes 100 emails/day, 3,000/month)

2. **Add your domain**
   - In Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"
   - Add `cleverlink.uk` as your domain
   - Follow the DNS verification instructions:
     - Add the provided TXT and MX records to your domain DNS settings
     - Wait for verification (usually takes a few minutes)

3. **Get your API key**
   - Go to "API Keys" in Resend dashboard
   - Create a new API key with "Sending access"
   - Copy the key (starts with `re_...`)

## Step 2: Deploy Supabase Edge Function

1. **Install Supabase CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. **Login to Supabase**
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

3. **Link your project**
   ```bash
   cd cleverlink
   supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```
   
   Find your project ref in your Supabase dashboard URL:
   `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_REF`

4. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Deploy the function**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy send-emails
   ```

## Step 3: Configure Email Sending Domains

In your Resend dashboard:

1. **Verify your domain ownership**
   - Ensure `cleverlink.uk` is verified and active

2. **Set up email addresses**
   The function uses these email addresses:
   - **From (confirmation emails)**: `hello@cleverlink.uk`
   - **From (notifications)**: `notifications@cleverlink.uk`
   - **To (notifications)**: `cleverlink.ai@outlook.com`

## Step 4: Test the Email System

1. **Test form submission**
   - Visit your website's contact form
   - Submit a test form with your email address
   - Check that you receive:
     - Confirmation email in your inbox
     - Notification email at `cleverlink.ai@outlook.com`

2. **Check Supabase function logs**
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs send-emails
   ```

3. **Check Resend dashboard**
   - View sent emails in your Resend dashboard
   - Monitor delivery status and any errors

## Step 5: DNS Configuration (Required)

Add these DNS records to your `cleverlink.uk` domain:

**For email sending (provided by Resend):**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: [Resend will provide this]

Type: MX
Name: @
Value: [Resend will provide this]
Priority: 10
```

**For receiving emails at cleverlink.ai@outlook.com:**
Make sure your Outlook email is properly configured to receive emails.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**
   - Check Supabase function logs for errors
   - Verify Resend API key is correctly set
   - Ensure domain is verified in Resend

2. **Domain verification fails**
   - DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate
   - Double-check DNS record values
   - Contact your domain registrar if needed

3. **Function deployment fails**
   - Ensure you're logged into Supabase CLI
   - Check your project reference is correct
   - Verify you have proper permissions

### Checking Logs

1. **Supabase function logs**
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs send-emails --follow
   ```

2. **Browser console**
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Check console for any JavaScript errors during form submission

3. **Resend dashboard**
   - Monitor email delivery status
   - Check for bounce/failure notifications

## Email Template Customization

The email templates are in `supabase/functions/send-emails/index.ts`. You can customize:

- **Styling**: Update the CSS in the `<style>` sections
- **Content**: Modify the email copy and structure
- **Branding**: Adjust colors, fonts, and logos

After making changes, redeploy the function:
```bash
supabase functions deploy send-emails
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Email limits**
   - Resend free tier: 100 emails/day, 3,000/month
   - Upgrade if you expect higher volume

2. **Domain reputation**
   - Use proper SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Monitor bounce rates and spam complaints

3. **Error handling**
   - Form submission succeeds even if emails fail
   - Monitor logs for email delivery issues

## Security Notes

- API keys are stored as Supabase secrets (encrypted)
- CORS is properly configured for your domain
- Email addresses are validated before sending

## Cost Breakdown

- **Resend**: Free tier (100 emails/day) â†’ $20/month (50,000 emails)
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Free tier (500K function invocations/month)
